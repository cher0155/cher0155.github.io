            <p> 
                Hi everyone! I'm Jeffrey Chery. You can simply call me Jeff or call me Cherry if you like (cause my last name resembles a fruit). I was born and raised in Ottawa my whole life. I come from a Haitian family. 
                 I can speak both <strong> English & French </strong> fluently and clearly. Throughout my whole life, I've went to french schools for my education. I'm currently at Algonquin College for the 2 year program <abbr title="Interactive Media Design">IMD</abbr> </p>
                 <p>I'm a person who likes to socialize a lot and be present with everything. I love to go out anywhere that's nature or many places in the city and have fun. I really love and appreciate arts such as music, photography, films, and <strong>espeically fashion</strong>. 
                 Fashion is something that I'm really passionate about and I consider it an external part of myself because I personally think it's a fun tool that I use to express and present my personality and my character in a very exciting and creative way.
                 One intresting fact about me, if you are into astrology, my astrological sign is <strong>Taurus</strong>.</p>
